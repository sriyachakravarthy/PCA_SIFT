#### 1. PCA-SIFT
This section involves:
- Computing PCA-SIFT feature descriptors.
- Modifying images using transformations like scaling, rotation, and Gaussian blur.
- Analyzing keypoints qualitatively and quantitatively.
  
The process includes:
- Image preprocessing
- PCA-SIFT descriptor calculation
- Matching keypoints between original and modified images
- Result visualization

#### 2. Image Classification
In this section, a custom CNN model is built and trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Key tasks include:
- Data preprocessing
- Building a CNN architecture with Conv, Sigmoid/ReLU activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- Evaluating performance using accuracy on test data.
- Comparing results between models using Sigmoid vs. ReLU activation functions.

### Images
Images are included throughout the report to demonstrate the process and results:
- PCA-SIFT keypoint detection results
- Image classification accuracy and loss plots
